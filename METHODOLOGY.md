# Membership Inference Attack Simulator: Design & Development Methodology

## Project Overview
This document outlines the methodology used to create an interactive web-based simulator that teaches users about membership inference attacks on machine learning models, with a focus on healthcare data privacy.

## Educational Goals
1. Help users understand membership inference attacks without requiring deep technical knowledge
2. Demonstrate real-world privacy implications in healthcare ML systems
3. Show how differential privacy can protect against these attacks
4. Create an engaging, hands-on learning experience

## User Experience Design

### Target Audience
- Healthcare professionals
- Privacy researchers
- Students learning about ML privacy
- Data scientists new to privacy concerns

### Design Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start with basic concepts
   - Gradually introduce more complex topics
   - Each stage builds upon previous knowledge

2. **Interactive Learning**
   - Hands-on experimentation with a simulated ML model
   - Real-time feedback on attack success rates
   - Visual representation of privacy-utility tradeoffs

3. **Visual Design**
   - Clean, medical-themed color palette (light blue background)
   - Clear typography hierarchy
   - Card-based UI for discrete pieces of information
   - Progress indicator for stage tracking

## Stage-by-Stage Methodology

### Stage 1: Basic Attack
**Goals:**
- Introduce the concept of membership inference
- Show how model confidence scores can leak information

**Design Decisions:**
- Limited to binary classification (patient has condition / doesn't have condition)
- Simple patient cards with clear visual distinction
- Immediate feedback on attack success

### Stage 2: Auxiliary Knowledge
**Goals:**
- Demonstrate how additional data improves attack accuracy
- Introduce the concept of shadow models

**Design Decisions:**
- Split screen showing training vs. auxiliary data
- Visual correlation between data distributions
- Interactive elements to test different attack strategies

### Stage 3: Differential Privacy
**Goals:**
- Show how privacy-preserving techniques work
- Demonstrate the privacy-utility tradeoff

**Design Decisions:**
- Interactive epsilon slider
- Real-time updates to model accuracy
- Visual representation of noise addition
- Clear charts showing the tradeoff relationship

## Interface Components

### Navigation
- Horizontal stage progression
- Clear stage labels
- Progress bar for visual feedback
- Ability to revisit previous stages

### Interactive Elements
1. **Patient Cards**
   - Clear presentation of health metrics
   - Confidence score display
   - Selection mechanism for attack attempts

2. **Model Information**
   - Training progress visualization
   - Accuracy metrics
   - Confidence score distribution

3. **Charts & Visualizations**
   - Privacy-utility tradeoff curve
   - Attack success rate tracking
   - Distribution comparisons

## Technical Implementation

### Framework Choices
- React for component-based UI
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Shadcn UI for consistent component styling
- Recharts for data visualization

### State Management
- React Query for data fetching
- Local state for user interactions
- URL-based stage tracking

### Performance Considerations
- Progressive loading of stage content
- Optimized re-renders
- Efficient data structure for patient records

## Testing Methodology

- Screen reader compatibility

### Content
- Clear, concise explanations
- Alternative text for visualizations
- Multiple formats for complex concepts

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. Additional attack scenarios
2. More complex model architectures
3. Downloadable resources
4. Interactive quizzes
5. Case studies from real-world incidents

### User Feedback Integration
